Introduction
=============

Spanish Public Administrations' websites must have a
so called "Contractors profile" in which the Administration
must publish all information about the different contracts
and its assignation procedure: public notice of it, the document
with the contract grant, the signature of the contract, ...

Each Administration wants to change the way to show this
information: PDF files, HTML text-fields, ... so we tried to
create the most generic product as possible and then let each
project change it.


Credits and legislation
=======================

- `Law 30/2007 of Public Sector Contracts (Ley 30/2007 de Contratos del Sector PÃºblico)`_
